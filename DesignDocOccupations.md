# Factions, Departments, Occupations and Goals

The purpose of the document is to outline a social system of Factions, Departments, Occupations and Goals with the intent to introduce some starting direction to the players and to allow for low level conflicts of interest to push interesting role playing scenarios. 

This system should only cause significant animosity in dire circumstances, it should be reasonable on a functioning ship for everyone to peacefully coexist and each achieve their Goal(s) but as the going gets tough this outcome becomes less and less likely.

Outright antagonism should still fall solely within the purview of the antag(s) and other extreme situations.

The system should also be low priority for most players. Secondary goals to the ones of the players own design or the ones of the game mode.

## Factions
The term “faction” for purposes of this document refers to overarching factions within the occupations system, not the specific Faction option found in character setup. Integration with that system may come later.

There are two major factions as part of the occupations system; Tradehouse Ivanmoth and the Enclave.

**Tradehouse Ivanmoth** is the main benefactor of the ship. It either owns the ship, or has hired it for the mission. They are in it for the profits but look down upon excessive exploitation of workers.

**The Enclave** represent a large fraction of the Yinglet Population on the ship. Their presence is due to a pre-existing agreement with House Ivanmoth. They have a separate command structure but are expected to follow the orders of the captain under the terms of the agreement. In practice, they are only loyal to the Matriarch, who does her best to make sure they don’t cause TOO much trouble for the captain. They are in it for their own reasons, known only to the Matriarch.

## Departments and Occupations and their goals

### Command
* Occupations: The Captain and the First Mate. Though the game should consider them part of two seperate departments, so their goals can be seperate.

**The Captain**

* Department Goal: “A tight ship: x/y Department goals complete.” This rewards him for having a more peacekeeping role and making sure everyone else does a good job.

The captain is the top of the command structure. His loyalty is split between Tradehouse Ivanmoth and his responsibilities of the crew. 
* Takes orders from none.
* Access: All (except Enclave Council access?)
* Skills: A generalist with a focus towards combat and piloting.
* Notable starting gear: None, but uniquely has access to the captains quarters, filled with “interesting” gear.
* Limitations: Human only. Max 1

**First Mate**

* Department Goal: “Company first: Accrue x amount of T in the Tradeship Ivanmoth account.” Nice and simple with lots of opportunity to develop adversity. Love of money is the root of all evils.

The first mate is the captain's right hand man. Hand picked by the Trademasters to ensure it’s interests are kept at heart. He takes orders from the captain but is loyal to House Ivanmoth first.
* Takes orders from the captain.
* Access: Too most rooms including all traditional departments and the bridge, but more limited in the gear he can operate. Can’t operate the accounts terminal, this is critical, else he can steal all the money straight away to achieve his goal.
* Skills: A generalist with a focus on Admin.
* Notable starting gear: The nicest suit. Tradeship Ivanmoths account card.
* Limitations: Tentatively both, firstmate yinglet is an interesting dynamic, with some lore precedent set out by Kass. Try it out, see if it works as intended. If plays out that it introduces too much internal conflict of interests to the role then we can swap it later. Max 1

### The Enclave
* Occupations: Matriarch, Patriarch, Enclave Scout, Enclave Yinglet.
* Department Goal: Random from a small list. Should always be slightly at odds with at least one other department and be for the benefit of the Enclave. “What are those scavs up to now?!?”

**Matriarch**

Leader of the yinglet enclave on the ship. She cares for all of the yinglets of the enclave but for her the health of the enclave as a whole comes first, above any individual life.
* Is supposed to take orders from the captain.
* Access: Bridge access and Enclave Council access access, maybe some department access.
* Skills: Admin with the potential to be well educated in acedemic fields (medicine, engineering, science)
* Notable starting gear: Unique clothing. (and some extra gear in her personal quarters if she has them)
* Limitations: Yinglet Female. Max 1

**Patriarch**

The patriarchy is composed of exemplars in their fields, and they serve as leaders and role models to the masses of younger males under their aegis. They keep the enclave functioning under the watchful eye and guidance of the matriarch.
* Takes orders from the Matriarch
* Access: Enclave Council access, maybe some department access.
* Skills: Hyper generalist, able to max any handful of skills they want.
* Notable starting gear: 
* Limitations: Yinglet Male. Max 4

**Enclave Scout**

Enclave Scouts are a type of yinglet specialist common in space faring missions. They have skills that make them apt at snooping around ships and planet surfaces in even measure.

**Enclave Yinglet**

Do as thou wilt. T

### The Traditional Departments
* Occupations: Department heads and Department Juniors
* Department goals: Vary per department but a all conclusive to the smooth running of this ship. Medical: Have low fatalities among the crew. Engineering: Keep air and power abover a certain level. Research: One of a few random reasearch goals per round. Perferably resualting in interesting and dangerous items.

**Department Heads**

Department heads keep their department focuse and in order.
* Takes orders for the Captain, sometimes the First Mate on the Captains behalf
* Access: Absolute access to their department and bridge access.
* Skills: As definied by their department
* Notable starting gear: The tools of their trade
* Limitations: Human. Max 1 per department.

**Department Juniors**

The main workforce upon the ship, they keep it running smoothly, make sure the crew is in good health and progress the march of science. The yinglets in these roles tend to be independant of the enclave, though happy to interact with their kind there.
* Takes order from their Department Head, the Captain and the First Mate
* Access: Near total access to their department.
* Skills: As definied by their department
* Notable starting gear: The tools of their trade
* Limitations: None
