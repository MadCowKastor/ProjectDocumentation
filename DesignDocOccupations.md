#Factions, Departments, Occupations and Goals

The purpose of the document is to outline a social system of Factions, Departments, Occupations and Goals with the intent to introduce some starting direction to the players and to allow for low level conflicts of interest to push interesting role playing scenarios. 

This system should only cause significant animosity in dire circumstances, it should be reasonable on a functioning ship for everyone to peacefully coexist and each achieve their Goal(s) but as the going gets tough this outcome becomes less and less likely.

Outright antagonism should still fall solely within the purview of the game mode and other extreme situations.

The system should also be low priority for most players. Secondary goals to the ones of the players own design or the ones of the game mode.

Factions
The term “faction” for purposes of this document refers to overarching factions within the occupations system, not the specific Faction option found in character setup. Integration with that system may come later.

There are two major factions as part of the occupations system; Tradehouse Ivanmoth and the Enclave.

Tradehouse Ivanmoth is the main benefactor of the ship. It either owns the ship, or has hired it for the mission. They are in it for the profits but look down upon excessive exploitation of workers.

The Enclave represent a large fraction of the Yinglet Population on the ship. Their presence is due to a pre-existing agreement with House Ivanmoth. They have a separate command structure but are expected to follow the orders of the captain under the terms of the agreement. In practice, they are only loyal to the Matriarch, who does her best to make sure they don’t cause TOO much trouble for the captain. They are in it for their own reasons, known only to the Matriarch.

Departments and Occupations and their goals
The Captain
Department of one.
Department Goal: “A tight ship: x/y Department goals complete.” This rewards him for having a more peacekeeping role and making sure everyone else does a good job.
The captain is the top of the command structure. His loyalty is split between Tradehouse Ivanmoth and his responsibilities of the crew. 
Department of one.
Takes orders from none.
Access: All (except enclave inner circle?)
Skills: A generalist with a focus towards combat and piloting.
Notable starting gear: None, but uniquely has access to the captains quarters, filled with “interesting” gear.
Race limitations: Human only.



First Mate
Department of one.
Department Goal: “Company first: Accrue x amount of T in the Tradeship Ivanmoth account.” Nice and simple with lots of opportunity to develop adversity. Love of money is the root of all evils.
The first mate is the captain's right hand man. Hand picked by the Trademasters to ensure it’s interests are kept at heart. He takes orders from the captain but is loyal to House Ivanmoth first.
Takes orders from the captain.
Access: Too most rooms including all traditional departments and the bridge, but more limited in the gear he can operate. Can’t operate the accounts terminal, this is critical, else he can steal all the money straight away to achieve his goal.
Skills: A generalist with a focus on Admin.
Notable starting gear: The nicest suit. Tradeship Ivanmoths account card.
Race limitations: Tentatively both, firstmate yinglet is an interesting dynamic, with some lore precedent set out by Kass. Try it out, see if it works as intended. If plays out that it introduces too much internal conflict of interests to the role then we can swap it later.

The Enclave
Occupations: Matriarch, Patriarch, Enclave Scout, Enclave Yinglet.
Department Goal: Random from a small list. Should always be slightly at odds with at least one other department and be for the benefit of the Enclave. “What are those scavs up to now?!?”

Matriarch
Leader of the yinglet enclave on the ship. She cares for all of the yinglets of the enclave but for her the health of the enclave as a whole comes first, above any individual life.
Is supposed to take orders from the captain.
Access: Bridge access and Enclave Inner Circle access.
Skills: Admin (with a splash of medical?)
Notable starting gear: Unique clothing. (and some extra gear in her personal quarters if she has them)
Race limitations: Yinglet Female.
