	reagents will become powder if all contents are solid, or a liquid if any contents are liquid, upon being poured from the container
	liquid reagents outside a container will splash on the ground and become a useless decal
	gasses can be used as reagents in a vapor chamber
	reagents with a boiling point should gradually evaporate into a gas form (like sublimator) above that boiling point, and condense into a liquid below it (vapor chamber used for containing them).
	reagents with a melting point should become a liquid above that point and a powder below it 
	objects can be ground into powder reagents in a mortar and pestle
	powdered reagents can be thrown into faces (entering blood through eyes and mouth, contact skin otherwise)

	randomized chem recipes
		- need to make sure there is no reaction collision 
		- need to make sure hints can be generated from steps
		- maybe specify a chain of reagents and some conditions for the steps needed to move between each (for constants/starting points)
			- ie. if you know that the next step always involves heating to 500K, the reaction can't contain any reagent that evaporates below that point
	- use for healthy healthy juice as a proof of concept, then maybe expand to other high tier chems

styptic powder
	- on contact,   stops bleeding, sterilizes wounds, and kickstarts healing
	- on injection, causes blood clots to form (heart damage?)
	- on ingestion, causes nausea
	- on overdose,  causes blood clots to form as injection

binding agent
	turns liquid reagents into powder stacks via a reaction

	- on contact, makes you sticky?????
	- on injection, causes organ damage
	- on ingestion, causes vomiting
	- on overdose,  causes more organ damage

mix binding agent and styptic powder to make synthetic skin
	synthetic skin
		- on contact,   shrinks and sterilizes burns, and kickstarts healing
		- on injection, causes blood clots to form
		- on ingestion, causes vomiting?
		- on overdose,  nothing

harvest entolimod from bacterial cultures
	maybe have some processing step between harvest and medication use
	entolimod protein
		- on contact,   does nothing
		- on injection, lowers radiation in the body while causing dizziness and nausea
		- on ingestion, insulates against radiation poisoning
		- on overdose,  causes organ damage and lowered white blood cell count

harvest adrenaline from adrenal glands (butchery product) or from bacterial cultures
	adrenaline
		- on contact,   does nothing
		- on injection, increases the shock threshold for passing out/going into asystole, causes jittering and shivering
		- on ingestion, causes jittering
		- on overdose,  causes heart and kidney damage

altrac powder
	basically meth/hyperzine
	- on contact, causes jittering
	- on ingestion, causes jittering, increased stamina regeneration, and increased move speed
	- on injection causes above + possible seizures
	- on overdose, causes seizures and berserk status (backport from Europa)

mix altrac powder and adrenaline to make combat stimulants
	combat stimulants
		increases melee damage
		hightened combined effects of both drugs, but with lower overdose threshold and harsher penalties
		inevitably causes tissue damage and organ scarring
	
biteleaf juice
	mild hallucinogen
	boil to biteleaf extract
		stronger hallucinogen

bruisegrass sap
	- on contact, causes burns
	- on injection, deadens pain, causes dizziness and rainbow effect
	- on ingestion, causes milder versions of the above
	- on overdose, causes seizures, hallucinations, and brain damage
	
	boil to bruisegrass extract
		much more severe effects, lower overdose threshold, always causes hallucinations
	
	dilute to make bruisegrass tea
		better painkiller, less hallucinations, higher overdose threshold
		
spingrass juice
	mild narcotic
	boil to spingrass extract
		stronger narcotic

"soap"

healthy-healthy juice
